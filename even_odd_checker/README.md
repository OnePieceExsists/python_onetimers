# 🔢 Even or Odd Checker (Python)

This simple Python script iterates through a predefined list of integers and prints whether each number is **even** or **odd**.

## 📄 Description

A basic Python program that demonstrates the use of:

- For loops
- Conditional statements (`if/else`)
- The modulo operator `%`
- f-strings for formatted output

Perfect for beginners who want to understand control flow and basic logic in Python.

## 🧪 Output Example

3 is odd
9 is odd
1 is odd
10 is even
5 is odd
2 is even
8 is even

## 💡 How It Works

- It iterates through a list of integers: `[3, 9, 1, 10, 5, 2, 8]`
- For each number, it checks if the number is divisible by 2 using the modulo operator (`%`)
- If divisible, it's **even**; otherwise, it's **odd**
- Prints the result with a descriptive message

## 💻 Run It Locally

1. Clone or download the script
2. Run it with Python 3:

```bash
python even_odd_checker.py
Make sure Python 3 is installed on your system.
